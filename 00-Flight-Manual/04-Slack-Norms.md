## How to Use Slack
Slack is a tool just like any other. The more you use it, the better you will become. You ability to use the tools common to the industry is also important. 

If you are not familiar with slack, I encourage you to watch this short video: https://youtu.be/b_biMJibhl8

## Slack Channels and Their Purpose
- #-announcements - This is for announcements only, please do not reply or ask questions in this channel.
- #-general - general class related commentary or links
- #01-live - Class work (discussion about class activities both durring and outside of class time)
- #02-community-ask - Ask your fellow classmates a question. Great for after-hours. May not be monitored by Instructional Staff (but usually is).
- #03-resources - Resources to help you on your way.  This is probably the best channel for you to keep up with the class materials.  Resources are posted at least once for every class and sometimes other resources become available.
- #04-homework support - Similar to "ask-the-class" but just for homework discussions.  May not be monitored by Instructional Staff (but usually is)
- #07-Career_Services - Information about Career Services.(will appear later)
- **These next few channels vary, but expect most of them and possible others**
- image_intros - post a picture of yourself that tells the class a little about you!
- extra_reviews - periodically we will have "extra" reviews that will cover both class materials and materials that are "bonus" from your instructional team.  This channel communicates these reviews.
- study_groups - Channel to bring up specific topics you would like to discuss during office hours.
