## Typing Speed

Some resources to consider:

### Keybr - https://www.keybr.com/

The keys you use for coding are often different the keys commonly used when typing English. Your English typing speed typically drops by 30% when typing code. Get practice with specific syntax here. I recommend the JavaScript jQuery track.
