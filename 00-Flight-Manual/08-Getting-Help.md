# Getting Help

Knowing how to get help is essential. Not just as a bootcamp student, but as a data professional. Below are a few resources, some specifically for your bootcamp. 

## Getting Help during a Breakout Session
To get help in class during a breakout session, i.e. class activities, Click "Ask for Help" button in the meeting controls. The first available member of the instructional staff will be there to help you. 

## Getting Help outside of Class
The instructional staff is not available outside of regular class hours. To receive help outside of these hours, you should be aware of the following avenues. 

### Ask the Class
The slack channels `02-community-ask` and `04-homework_help` are provided for you as resources to ask your fellow classmates for assistance. Oftentimes, simply taking the time to write out your question helps you find your error. This is part of rubber-duck debugging. https://rubberduckdebugging.com/

### Tutoring Sessions
As part of your program fees, a tutor is available to you at no additional cost. To register for a tutor, please reachout to @Admin1 in slack



### AskBCS Learning Assistants in Slack
AskBCS Learning Assistant is an application within Slack. You can use AskBCS Learning Assistants to submit curriculum-based questions to a live person during normal operating hours.

## Overall Principles
1. *Read AND Google the error message first.* Most error messages have already been solved on the internet. Search for it!
2. *Include your code.* A snippet of the code or a link to the GitHub repo is helpful. 
3. *Be specific.* Saying, "I have an error" isn't helpful. Copy/pasting the exact error text and/or providing a screenshot *is*. 
4. *Include a screenshot.* Sometimes, seeing the issue in context helps us solve the problem. 
5. *Include a screencast.* If the bug is an issue that only occurs when you interact with a page, it may be helpful to record a video of that interaction.
